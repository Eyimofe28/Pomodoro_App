# Pomodoro Timer

In this project, I implemented the Pomodoro Technique in a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the `tkinter` library in Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The application helps users manage their time efficiently by providing a timer that alternates between work periods and breaks. This code is modular and easy to understand. It is a great starting point for those interested in learning about GUI development in Python.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Implements the Pomodoro Technique with customizable work and break intervals.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the current mode (work/break) and time remaining.
- **Checkmarks**: Tracks completed work sessions with checkmarks.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset the timer and all progress.
